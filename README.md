# Stick Hero Game

Welcome to the Stick Hero Game! This JavaFX application challenges you to control a character by extending a stick to cross platforms without falling. Navigate through diverse challenges using precise timing and strategic gameplay.

## Introduction

This project implements a clone of the mobile game "Stick Hero." The game was created using JavaFX and FXML, leveraging core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

### Key Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Character Control**: Navigate Stick-Hero by extending a stick to bridge platform gaps.
- **Precision Timing**: Timing is crucial to land on platforms; missing results in a fall and game over.
- **Reviving Feature**: Collect cherries to revive once, reducing your score on revival.
- **Reward Collection**: Collect cherries by flipping upside down, contributing to your score.
- **Scoring System**: Aim for higher scores by collecting rewards.
- **Progress Saving**: Save game progress, including scores and collected cherries.
- **Enhancements**: Graphics, sound effects, and animations for an immersive experience.
